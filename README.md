Hello Everyone and welcome to my project' Repo!

INTRO

This web app was design mobile first but can run smoothly on a desktop aswell. 

On the Front-End, this app uses HTLM5, CSS, React, Redux & Styled-Components

On the Back-End, this app uses Node, Express & Firebase

The API used can be found at this website: https://spoonacular.com/food-api . The API was great, but the free tier was very limited as far as daily usages. Would still recommend tho!
