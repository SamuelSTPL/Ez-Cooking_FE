Hello Everyone and welcome to my final project' Repo! I built this web app from scratch as a final project from Concordia Bootcamp (in Montreal). It was my first real Full-Stack project!

INTRO

This web app was design mobile first but can run smoothly on a desktop aswell. 

On the Front-End, this app uses HTLM5, CSS, React, Redux & Styled-Components

On the Back-End, this app uses Node, Express & Firebase

The API used can be found at this website: https://spoonacular.com/food-api . The API was great, but the free tier was very limited as far as daily usages. Would still recommend tho!

Visit the website at this URL : https://ez-cooking.netlify.app

To deploy the FE, I used Netlify, and for the BE, I used Heroku.


ABOUT THE WEBSITE

Ez-Cooking is a recipe finder application. You can use an extensive amount of filters to find the perfect meal for you. It is free, and a subscription is not required. If you do subcribe however, you will be able to save your favorite recipes. The app was design to be very easy to use on both phone and desktop!



Here you can see how filters work and how recipes are displayed.
